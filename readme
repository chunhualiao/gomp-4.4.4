This directory is extracted from gcc-4.4.4/libgomp
The purpose is to have a self-contained libgomp which can be built.

1. How to build libgomp
---------------------------------------
To build libgomp.a, type
./configure
make

libgomp.a will be generated under 
ls -l .libs/libgomp.a

libgomp.a under the current directory is a fake one for libtool.

2. How to use a specific libgomp
---------------------------------------
By default, gcc will use its own libgomp installed systemwide.
If you want to use a specific version of libgomp with your customization,
you have to explicitly link the right libgomp.

For example, to compile testsuite/libgomp.c/hello.c 
  cd testsuite/libgomp.c
  gcc -fopenmp -c hello.c # -c means compile only
  # Now you can link .o with libgomp.a, plus pthread
  gcc -o hello.out hello.o ../../.libs/libgomp.a  -lpthread
